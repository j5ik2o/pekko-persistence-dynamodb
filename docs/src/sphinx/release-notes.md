## Unreleased

### Java 11 is the documented minimum version

The README and the overview claimed Java 1.8+, while CI tested Java 11, 17, and 19. The product decision is to document the versions that CI tests, so the documents now name Java 11, 17, and 19. Java 8 is no longer a supported configuration.

The build still targets Java 8 bytecode, so an existing Java 8 deployment can run these artifacts. CI does not test that configuration.

The `schema-check` version check fails when the documented versions and the CI matrix disagree. To keep Java 8 support, add it to the matrix in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and to both documents.
